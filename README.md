A band consisting of Linux and Automation Engineers, they overclock their Amps and have to put silicon thermal paste on their strings.

They have described as the Spinal Tap of DevOps but this is vigorously disputed by the band.

> They were a bunch of comedians pretending to be a band, we are deadly serious about this!!!

Although in their day jobs, they use the latest tech, they only play songs from before the Unix Epoch on the 1 of January 1970.

Thier sound is that of 70's garage punk, cross with disco, soul and Motown.

They despise the genre of DevOps, claiming it is fake and it sold out to the man.
