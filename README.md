A band consisting of Linux and Automation Engineers, they overclock their Amps and play so fast they have to put silicon thermal paste on their strings.

They have been described as the Spinal Tap of IT but this is strongly disputed by the band.

They have a unbalanced outlook on the world, confusing tech trends with genres of music.

They dismiss the sub culture of DevOps, claiming it is fake and of selling out to the man.

Although in their day jobs, they use the latest tech, they only play songs that were written before the Unix Epoch on the 1 of January 1970.

Their sound is that of 70's Garage Rock, mixed with Soul and Motown.
