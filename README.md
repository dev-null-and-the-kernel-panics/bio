A band consisting of Linux and Automation Engineers, they overclock their Amps and play so fast they have to put silicon thermal paste on their strings.

They have been described as the Spinal Tap of IT but this is strongly disputed by the band.

They dismiss the genre of DevOps, claiming it is fake and it sold out to the man.

Although in their day jobs, they use the latest tech, they only play songs from before the Unix Epoch on the 1 of January 1970.

Thier sound is that of 70's garage punk, mixed with soul and Motown.
